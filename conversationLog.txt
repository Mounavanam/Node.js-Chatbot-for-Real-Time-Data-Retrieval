Another hijacked plane crashed into the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, and a fourth plane, United Airlines Flight 93, crashed into a field in Pennsylvania after passengers attempted to overpower the hijackers.

The attacks resulted in the deaths of nearly 3,000 people and caused significant destruction and devastation. The 9/11 attacks had a profound impact on the United States and the world, leading to changes in national security policies, military interventions, and increased awareness of the threat of terrorism.
