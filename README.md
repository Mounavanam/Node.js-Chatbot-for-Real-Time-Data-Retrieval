# Node.js Chatbot for Real-Time Data Retrieval
Developed an interactive chatbot using Node.js that integrates with OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo and external APIs to deliver real-time weather updates and news other info through a command-line interface. 

### Tech stack
- Node.js
- OpenAI API
- Axios for HTTP requests
- asynchronous JavaScript (async/await)
- readline for CLI interactions

### Key Highlights of the project
- API Integration: Integrated with OpenWeatherMap API to fetch and display current weather conditions based on user queries, enhancing the chatbotâ€™s utility with real-time data retrieval.
- Data Handling and Logging: mplemented robust logging mechanisms to record all user interactions and bot responses, facilitating future data analysis to improve the bot's performance.
- Error Management:  Designed to handle API errors gracefully, ensuring the chatbot operates reliably under varying conditions and maintains a high level of user engagement without interruptions.
- User Interaction: Crafted a responsive command-line user interface that interprets and responds to user inputs in real-time, demonstrating proficiency in creating engaging user experiences in terminal applications.

### Usage
- Install dependencies
     .npm install
-Run the bot
     .npm start
### How can it be extended further?
- Context-Aware Conversations: Enhance the chatbot's ability to maintain context over multiple interactions. This can be achieved by integrating more sophisticated NLP libraries.
- Database Integration: Use a database to store user preferences or history to personalize the conversation.
